# ft_transcendence

Classic Pong game running on a website, with various optional modules.

We haven't decided on all the modules yet, but probably we will:
  - Use Django for backend
  - Bootstrap for frontend
  - Docker for the environment (not a module, part of the mandatory 25%)
  - Pong in JavaScript (part of the mandatory 25%).
  - Store the score of a tournament in the Blockchain
  - Introduce an AI opponent.
  - Implement WAF/ModSecurity with hardened configuration and HashiCorp Vault for Secrets Management
  - Infrastructure Setup for Log Management
  - Replacing basic Pong with server-side Pong and implementing an API
